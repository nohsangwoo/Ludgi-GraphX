## 📌 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **npm** (or yarn/pnpm)
- **Ludgi CLI** (installed automatically with this project)

---

## 📥 Installation

To get started with **Ludgi GraphX**, install it as a dependency:

```bash
npx create-ludgi-graphx my-graphql-project
cd my-graphql-project
npm install
```

This will scaffold a complete **GraphQL API automation** project with Express and Next.js.

---

⚠️ Prerequisites:
This application requires the following Docker containers to be running:

- Redis

The application will not function properly unless these services are running.

**Note:** If you want to use subscriptions with Ludgi CLI, it is configured to work based on Redis. Therefore, make sure Redis is running to enable this feature.

---

### Start Redis Container

```bash
sh docker-compose/redis/up.sh
```

## ⚙️ Usage

### 1️⃣ Generate a GraphQL Query or Mutation

Use **Ludgi CLI** to generate a new GraphQL query or mutation file:

```bash
npx ludgi-cli -n <queryOrMutationName>
```

Example:

```bash
npx ludgi-cli -n getUserProfile
```

This will create a new GraphQL file inside the **GraphQL directory** of your project.

---

### 2️⃣ List All GraphQL Queries & Mutations

```bash
npx ludgi-cli -l
```

This command will display all GraphQL queries and mutations present in your project.

---

### 3️⃣ Delete a GraphQL Query or Mutation

```bash
npx ludgi-cli -d <queryOrMutationName>
```

Example:

```bash
npx ludgi-cli -d getUserProfile
```

This removes the specified GraphQL file from your project.

```graphql
query GetUserProfile($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    id
    name
